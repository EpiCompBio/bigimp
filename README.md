# bigimp

The goal of bigimp is to make imputation of large datasets easier.
It relies on the R packages mice and VIM to do the hard work.
It contains many convenience and addtional functions to randomly subset a large dataset (i.e. of tens of columns and tens of thousands of rows) in order to impute.
Functions for pre- and post-imputation diagnostic stats and plots are included.

It's *UNDER DEVELOPMENT*...
